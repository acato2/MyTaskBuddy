# MyTaskBuddy


MyTaskBuddy is a mobile application developed as part of my bachelor thesis, designed as a simple planner with a focus on coordination and time tracking for individuals with Down syndrome. 

The main goal of this application is to assist people with Down syndrome in efficiently organizing their tasks, planning their time, and monitoring their daily activities.

The project successfully accomplished the integration of a web application and a mobile application called "MyTaskBuddy." 

The mobile application is designed for individuals with Down syndrome, while the web application is utilized by parents and teachers to manage user tasks. Notably, both applications are connected to the same database, facilitating seamless data synchronization between the mobile and web platforms.

- Statistics and Average Task Time

The app automatically calculates the average time taken by the user to complete each task and sends this data to the connected web application in the Statistics section.

This functionality provides parents or teachers with insights into the average time required for task completion and offers information about the user's progress.
